Imperial TIE Interceptor     (Featured in the STAR WARS
       with interior         trilogy by LucasFilm Ltd.)


Manufacturer: Sienar Fleet Systems (SFS)
Weapons: Four SFS L-s9.3 laser cannons
Crew: One pilot
Speed: 125 MGLT, not hyperdrive equipped.

Hello, I have attempted to design a realistic TIE interior
with fans of the Star Wars films in mind.

The hatches can be posed open. The "Top Hatch latch cover"
(Hcv175TH)*, is designed to open before the hatch raises
or shuts then close to cover it's latch well. I guess you
could use it as a hinge if you believe the Top Hatch pivots
at the rear.

-----------------------
* Hcv175TH = H-cv-175-TH

H=Hull (prefix), T_=transparent as glass (opacity).
cv=cover (part name)
175=color (number (in gray scale)), Cri=crimson, DrG=dark green, etc.
TH=Top Hatch (suffix), BH=Back Hatch, US=Unsmoothed -VERY IMPORTANT!!
If the part does not have a "_US" or "US" as a suffix it means that
part is smoothed to a 45 degree angle. Not all parts have suffixs.
-----------------------

I regret that the eight-character-type hierarchy (parts
list) is not as clear as it could be. Some programs
truncate the instance names to eight characters. I also
do this for maximum 3ds format compatibility. I hope
the above key helps. I will try to answer your email
questions.

The instrument panels have separate back panels and front
"glass" so you may remove the gizmo's I came up with and
apply your own with textures and reflection maps.

I hope you find the model interesting. Jim
